# conference-notes

Hey, I decided to start taking and publishing notes at conferences I go to.
Obligatory disclaimers: these notes are taken in haste to keep up with the
presentations and thus are subject to having typos, mistakes, and total
misinterpretations. Feel free to submit pull requests if I missed something.

## Keywords

I'll use the following keywords in the notes

- `Note:`: not part of the talk, just something I thought of and wanted to
  note for later
- `(?)`: not sure if I got the preceding part right
- `ACTION:`: stuff to do once I get home
