# conference-notes

Hey, I decided to start taking and publishing notes at conferences I go to.
Obligatory disclaimers: these notes are taken in haste to keep up with the
presentations and thus are subject to having typos, mistakes, and total
misinterpretations. Feel free to submit pull requests if I missed something.
