# Cognitive Biases in Engineering Organizations

- Example time right away! Sales sell a nonexistant feature, company thinks
  it's possible in 4 weeks. After 2 weeks engineer realizes 8 weeks is
  required, company decides to cut corners, they ship some crap in 6 weeks,
  and loses the customer.
- Here we have projection bias: people don't realize there are others with
  different priorities and attitutes.
  - Solve this with role switching.
- We also had the manager with the planning fallacy: always underestimating.
  - Solve this with prototyping, using past information, and planning poker.
  - Planning poker works because the reference point is new, the points are
    not equal to time and they don't translate across teams
  - Don't use points for large projects
- We see the bandwagon effect: the engineer adopts the attitude of others
  and accepts the deadline.
   - To fix it, make decisions asynchronously; planning poker fixes this
- Sunk cost fallacy is here too: the first two weeks' investment should not
  be considered when deciding what to do after two weeks.
- Hyperbolic Discounting: out of 2 similar rewards we prefer the one
  arriving earlier.
  - See the Marshmallow Experiment. Kids who could wait longer went on to
    be more successful.
- Fundamental Attribution Error: internal characteristics are used to explain
  others' behavior instead of external factors, this is why the CEO wants to
  fire someone.
- Don't trust your intuition.
- Note: there are some examples given that would be difficult to write down
  but are pretty important to hear.
- Free to play games are often based on the sunk cost fallacy, which is also
  why you watch a bad movie to the end, or finish a crappy meal.
