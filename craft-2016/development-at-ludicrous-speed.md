# You Can Have It All: Software Development at Ludicrous Speed

- A latent construct is a construct based around feelings, psychomterics is a
  field of science to get correct data from people
- Organizations are power, rule, or performance oriented, see slide for more
  details about the categorization
  - Note: This wasn't really part of the point but I think that table was
    worth noting.
- Puppet Labs reports that good IT = profitability
  - The top predictor of org performance is job satisfaction though
- Psychological safety is the first 'key of successful teams at Google'
  as per rework; that is, people should not be afraid to fail.
- IT performance can be measured by lead time for changes, release frequency,
  time to restore service, and change fail rate. Obviously not by lines of
  code or velocity.
- Version controlling configuration is more correlated with IT performance than
  version controlling code, in part because it's easier to get a testing
  environment, and it also helps with time to recovery.
- Small commits merged into master daily correlate with IT performance.
- External peer review does not work, has no positive impact on stability.
- Study by presenter: The Role of Continuous Delivery in IT and Organizational
  Performance. Check it for actual numbers about the effects of all the things.
- Commercial config management tools are totally uncorrelated with IT
  performance. Open source positively correlates.
- Developers should create tests and not QA. Probably because it pushes them to
  write testable code.
- Somehow having test envs available on demand is not correlated.
- Requiring code review only for high risk changes is not correlated.
- Note: TODO: Read up on WIP limits. A few slides were totally lost on me
  cause I'm not familiar with the concept or term.
- Test the obvious with data. You should see some surprises and some confirmed
  hypotheses as well, otherwise something is wrong.
- Devops culture definitely has a measurable positive impact on IT.
