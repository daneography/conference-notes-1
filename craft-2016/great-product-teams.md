# Great Product Team, Successful Product

http://beta.craft-conf.com/speaker/MartyCagan

- The biggest reasons most teams fail are too many steps before the ideas reach
  the developers (roadmaps, product managers, requirements)
- Dual track agile a.k.a. continuous discovery is a much better way, adds
  discovery stage, consists of rapid tests (10-20 per week per team) replacing
  the requirements by the PM and the roadmap.
- The teams need to be together for a while and they need to work well
  together â€” good chemistry required
- Colocated teams are the best (design, ux, devs, etc. literally all next to
  each other, in the same room)
- No member should be afraid to share their ideas. Not the juniors, not the
  designers.
- Product people, UX designers, engineers are all needed in each team (design
  is not needed for APIs)
- Autonomy is when a team gets to choose how to accomplish their assigned
  business goals.
- The company needs to have a common vision (what do we want in 2-5 years?)
  - You need this for good recruitment as well, the vision is why people join,
    see tesla
- Tesla's product strategy given as an example of an awesome one, theirs was
  based on persona segmentation, you could also do geosegmentation for example
- Make sure success is not measured by releases or velocity, but problems solved.
- **No roadmaps**, give a prioritized list of objectives like 'reduce onboarding
  time by 50%' and let them figure out how to do that.
- **The product manager needs to be very good.**
- It's a difficult job because of the need to come up with solutions that
  work with a million constraints.
- A weak PM lets the executives choose the solutions or they call the
  stakeholders (lawyers, marketing, etc.) to a meeting, which results in
  design by committee and makes the product even worse. Way better to meet each
  of these people one by one.
- They definitely need a good tech background.
- Design changes functionality and functionality drives design as well, they are
  totally intertwined, which is why the designers and devs absolutely need to be
  collaborating
- Product discovery is way faster than an MVP, 'build stuff that doesn't scale'.
- Focus on the key risks
  - Value risk is the first and most important, people might not actually want a
    product like yours, most products fail on this
  - Usability risk should be mostly alleviated if you use product discovery
  - Feasibility risk is whether it's even possible to complete a thing (enough
    money, time, etc.)
  - Stakeholder risk is whether other departments will be okay with your
    solutions
- An MVP is usually just a crippled product but that's not the point. An MVP
  should never be an actual product. It should be an experiment just to see
  whether the idea even works before committing to it.
- You need both quantitative and qualitative testing.
- Stick to your guns and don't release software that's not ready yet.
- Great team obsess over their customers, words are not enough
  - One such team doesn't think their customers are stupid, know some of them
    by name, get on the phone with them to solve things, etc.
  - It's nice to give some sales training to the product team though if they
    are going to talk to a customer.
