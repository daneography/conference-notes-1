# Hacking Monkeys: a practitioners guide

Presenter has a healthcare, education, and energy background (GE).

- 'Overcoming limitations to achieve clever outcomes' - definition of hacking
- The Five Monkey Experiment was described.
  - Which is a hoax by the way. Welp.
- Still, let's break it down! Components are the cage, the troop, and you (me,
  I guess)
- The C-suite wants business outcomes, managable speed, stable orgs, and to
  understand cost.
  - Or so it was in the olden days.
  - Now we have customer outcomes, breakneck speed, learning orgs, and
    understanding risks with Uber, Airbnb, etc.
  - So, this was the cage
- GE has some newish beliefs: Customers determine success, stay lean,
  learn & adapt, empower & inspire, deliver results in an uncertain world
- But no one listened or changed anything. They need experiences for that.
  That's how they build beliefs, which turn into actions, which in turn
  yield results.
  - Sadly learning is left to right, but measuring is right to left in this
    list. Similarly, leading is left to right, managing is right to left.
- GE launched a software dept. in 2011, they started a proprietrary IoT
  platform. They realized that it's not going to work.
- Note: Tons of visual material, some entertaining, some informative.
- The industrial internet sweet spot is the cross-section of big data, big
  compute, big context, inside a secure environment, on solid foundations.
  - Note: Maybe I'll be able to make sense of this some day.
- Resilience is build on a physical aspect and an emotional aspect and a
  mental aspect and a spiritual aspect and I'm totally lost. What's this talk
  about?
- Purpose is made up of internal and external factors.
- Note: I give up.
