# Becoming Polyglot

https://craft-conf.com/speaker/LornaMitchell

## Level 1: Successfully run code

- Just get unfamiliar code to run
- Check projects of the language on GitHub
- Some thing are a nice starting point and have a lot in common
  - like dependency managers,
  - and logging
- Be an antelope: in the face of danger, just freeze, and think

## Level 2: Successfully edit code

- Make sure to see output
- Add log lines that stand out from the other ones
- Optimize the cycle time!
  - Use `fswatch` to automate build commands
  - Specifically `fswatch -0 -o <glob> | xargs -0 -n1 -I{} <command>`
- To work with HTTP,
  use curl/Postman/Paw/Fiddler, RequestBin, NGrok, Wireshark, Charles Proxy

## Level 3: Learn to separate dev and live environments

- Must know git. Must know it well. Absolutely must.
  - Handling multiple remotes, undoing, rebasing

## Level 4: Learn how to copy-paste code

- Now you learn how to copy and paste code
- Search for solutions, and be able to use them
- Also, know what code to trust. Be suspicious of old answers.

## Level 5: Create a simple app from scratch

- Think about dependencies, directory structure, templating languages, etc.
- Keep doing all the things already covered above

## Level 6: Participate in the community

- Stop lurking
- Ask questions, cause how else would we learn?
- Get a mentor, here first. Before this point
  probably all your questions could be answered by searching
- Consider sharing the answers you find
  - Few years older you will also thank you for this
  - Exception is if the question was answered by the open source maintainer
    because then there's no 'consider,'
    **you're morally obliged** to make sure
    they don't have to answer the same question again.

## Level 7: Get paid

- Understand how much you already have
- You should already be
  - thinking about your tooling,
  - follow security practices,
  - be familiar with testing tools,
  - and stay up-to-date with changes

## Level 8: Iterate and improve

- Have a decent build server and stuff like that

## Level 9: Mentor and teach others

- You should realize you can help those behind you
- You yourself learn a lot from this as well

## Level 10: Dream in this new language

- We don't all get here, and it's not always the goal
- You maintain a library maybe,
  or perhaps contribute to the language itself
- Choose what to learn next!

## Q&A

### Is it a problem to skip to getting paid?

Nah! Fake it till you make it. You may surprise yourself, too.

### How do you manage a personal knowledge base?

Please set up a personal blog!
You don't even need the site,
just write content. Content is king.
