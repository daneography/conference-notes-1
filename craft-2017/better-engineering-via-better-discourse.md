# Better engineering via better discourse

https://craft-conf.com/speaker/TheoSchlossnagle

- People using laptops during talks are missing out on a huge opportunity
  when they don't pay that much attention
- "If you ever had impostor syndrome, just look at someone else's code!"
- Ethics influence the health of the industry
  - Volkswagen made the outlook look pretty bad
  - Software engineers are often like teenagers regarding discipline
- We have to grow up, we have to participate in the maturing the industry

## A Story

- Speaker once had a whole airport shut down on him over a snowstorm.
  Agent accidentally unbooked speaker
  instead of moving him to a different flights.
  Even the manager couldn't override,
  and all flights were booked for 2 weeks.
- When greeted by system failure, you start locally optimizing, like
  - "get a bit closer to home,"
  - or "get people to not want to leave (and leave space.)"
- More misfortune for the speaker, lost credit card, hotel problems, etc.
  - Speaker gets a luxury suite as apology. Speaker had a 5am flight though.
- Rerouted, gets *further* from home.
- Parked car was covered in snow at home, huge parking fees too.

## Moral

- In open source, you're having online discussions
  where you don't interact with people.
  - Trolling can be satisfying cause of this detach
  - It's hard to break bad news, no body language, etc.
- In person discussions are different
  since the human contact instills empathy
  and causes you to feel guilt if you're a jerk.
- In person teams can argue and be more careless with their wording.
- Conferences are also great for the same reason.
  You can have disagreements successfully.
- Attacking ideas is okay, attacking people is not.
  - It's dangerous to attack ideas
- You can walk away from a belief if it's obsolete
- The rising generation of millenial software engineers have a problem
  stemming from generational change
  which is the conflation of idea and self
- "Ideas that offend me are not welcome around me" is a dangerous mindset.
- To communicate bad ideas
  don't do "look at all the good things I did"
  since they internalize failure
  instead of recognizing patterns of what's worked well.
- So try to communicate through stories of personal failure
- Set the expectations of the audience by admitting if you're not an expert.
  The stage gives you perhaps unjust implied credibility.
- People are the hardest problem in most things since we're not rational.
- When debating,
  make sure not to use [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com).
- Everyone wants to be better at communication
- Exceptional communicators are compatible even with bad listeners
- And exceptional listeners can extract value even from bad communicators
- "Criticism is the only reliable form of autobiography." — Oscar Wilde
- Bias is often strong and useful, but also often a horrible enemy
  - E.g. avoiding a dark alley without analyzing data on it is useful.
  - But bias is what makes you stupid.
    As a listener it's your job to suspend your biases.

## Actual Moral

- Listen, share learn
- Get uncomfortable, be challenged
- Defend and attack ideas
- Respect and empathize with your fellow humans
