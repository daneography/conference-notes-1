- Speaker's ADHD — surprisingly — does not help with career goals
- work = time * focus
- Time is mostly constant, you need to optimize focus
- Willpower and creativity are finite resources
- If you don't have these resources available, you do shallow work
- "Workaholics aren't heroes"
- The way you become productive is you focus on deep work

## Work Environment

- No open plan offices:
  they cause more sick days, higher stress levels, it sounds really bad
- NOTE: Talk has a cool history of office architecture/design,
  check the video for that
- Put effort into designing your work environment with no distractions
- Managers should not discourage people from working from home
- "[management] is about creating conditions for people to do their best work"
- There's no benefits to having a phone at your desk, why not remove it?
  - TODO: seriously, why not, huh

## Prevent Crunch Time

- Doesn't work for more than a couple of weeks
- You end up getting less done
- It also increases your error rate
- Increases technical debt too, decreases tests and docs
- After adjusting for all of this, you're already worse off on the second week
- Recovery from crunch takes twice the time of crunch

## Questions

### How do you fight interruption?

Use async communication. Turn off notifications.

### Does headphones + music work?

Active noise cancelling is great, but lots of distractions are visual.
