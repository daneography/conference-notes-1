# Programming Python as performance: live coding with FoxDot

https://2018.pycon.sk/en/speakers/Kirkbride.html

- toplap.org is a community for this
- You edit code, run it, listen to the generated audio, and repeat
- NOTE: Not taking notes of history of live coding
  - Algorave Movement since 2001
- Live coding has lots of flexibility and has no limits imposed by UI
- It's "the most live" that music performance can be, on the level of jazz
- There are a couple of languages: SuperCollider, tidalcycles, Sonic Pi
  - No Man's Sky's music was made with tidalcycles
  - Sonic Pi is used for teaching small children coding
- Speaker made FoxDot to have
  - Objects with state
  - Focus on musical patterns instead of audio processing
  - Cleaner syntax
- NOTE: Description of how to use it too technical for me to note them down
  Check the vid around 15-20 minutes in.
- NOTE: *Hoooly shit* the music is gorgeous, please, please watch the video!
